Misc. notes from courses I have taken / read up on. Part of a project to type up the notes I have made by hand throughout the years.

These are my interpretations of the material. Typos, and worst, think-o's, are entirely my own (please do contact me at jclmak@ust.hk about it)

If there are comments or even pull requests, please open an issue or a pull request accordingly.

I have tried to use material that are either self-made, open source, or those that are explicitly ok for fair use. If however there is copyright material (particularly with images) that copyright holders want taken down, please let me know either by e-mail, GitHub message or open an issue.

Principal acknowledgements:

* The lecturers of the undergraduate MMath course I took at Durham (individual lecturers in document)
* The lecturers of the MAGIC courses I took whilst a PhD student at Leeds
* Various copyright holders who made images (they should all be cited accordingly)
